README
	This file

misc/	
	Source files for the Y86-64 assembler yas, the Y86-64 instruction
	simulator yis, and the isa.c file that is used by the processor
	simulators to check the results against the
	ISA simulation.

seq/	
	Code for the SEQ simulator.  Contains HCL files for
	labs and homework problems that involve modifying SEQ.

pipe/	
	Code for the PIPE simulator.  Contains HCL files for labs and
	homework problems that involve modifying PIPE.

y86-code/
	Example .ys files from CS:APP and scripts for conducting
	automated benchmark teseting of the new processor designs.

ptest/
