This directory contains the code to construct simulators for SEQ
and the variants of it described in the homework exercises.

**************************
1. Building the simulators
**************************

Different versions of the SEQ simulator can be constructed
to use different HCL files when working on the different homework
problems.

Binary	VERSION	HCL File	Description
ssim	std	seq-std.hcl	Standard SEQ simulator described in textbook.
ssim	full	seq-full.hcl	For adding iaddq to SEQ.

Once you've configured the Makefile, you can build the different
simulators with commands of the form

	unix> make clean; make ssim VERSION=xxx

where "xxx" is one of the versions listed above.  For example, to build
the version of SEQ described in the CS:APP text based on the control
logic in seq-std.hcl, type

	unix> make clean; make ssim VERSION=std

To save typing, you can also set the Makefile's VERSION variable.

***********************
2. Using the simulators
***********************
A simulator prints all information
about its runtime behavior on the terminal.  It's hard to understand what's
going on, but useful for automated testing, and doesn't require any
special installation features.

The simulators take identical command line arguments:

Usage: ssim [-ht] [-l m] [-v n] file.yo

file.yo optional (default stdin)

   -h     Print this message
   -l m   Set instruction limit to m (default 10000)
   -v n   Set verbosity level to 0 <= n <= 2 (default 2)
   -t     Test result against the ISA simulator (yis)
